## Immersive-Cooking
Immersive Cooking is an ambitious Minecraft datapack that aims to revamp the entire hunger system by with a creative free-form cooking system. It nerfs simple foods like baked potatoes and cooked porkchops, while providing new ways to mix ingredients to create even better food items. Bake, boil, fry, stack, mash, chop, mix, squeeze, and brew your way to the best meal you've ever tasted (in Minecraft).
